    "weatherInfo": "Shenandoah experiences four distinct seasons. Best known for its fall foliage, the park is also spectacular in spring when the wildflowers and trees are in full bloom. Summer brings lush greens and relief from the hot valleys. The park's elevation encourages as much as a 10 degree temperature difference. In winter, this means that when surrounding lowlands are experiencing rain, the the park can be blanketed in snow and ice. It's always a good idea to be prepared for varying weather.",
